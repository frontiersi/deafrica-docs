Digital Earth Africa Sandbox
============================

The Sandbox is a learning and analysis environment for getting started with
Digital Earth Africa and the Open Data Cube. It includes sample data and
Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the capability of the Open Data Cube.

Register
--------

The Sandbox is free to use. Visit https://sandbox.digitalearth.africa/ to sign up 
for a new account, or sign in if you have an existing account. 

If registering, you must provide a username, name, email address and password, as

Access
------

After signing in, the Sandbox will prepare a JupyterLab environment for you.
All necessary software is provided as part of this environment, so no additional
installation or configuration is required. 

When accessing the Sandbox you may be provided with some Server Options, as 
presented below. Click the Start button to proceed using default Sandbox 
environment.

Eventually, your Sandbox environment will be initialised. As the system prepares
the environment, you should see a loading screen similar to figure below.

Learning Jupyter
================

Overview
--------
Jupyter is an interactive coding environment. The name ‘Jupyter’ comes from Julia, Python and R, which are all programming
languages that are used in scientific computing. Jupyter started as a purely Python-based environment, called iPython, but
there has been rapid progress over the last few years.

Navigating the Jupyter Lab Interface
------------------------------------
The Jupyter Lab interface consists of several sections that require explanation. These sections are presented and explained 
below.

The main work area (1) enables you to arrange documents (notebooks, text files, etc.) and other activities (terminals, code 
consoles, etc.) into panels of tabs that can be resized or subdivided. Most of you work will be done here. The left sidebar (2) 
contains a file browser, the list of running kernels and terminals, the command palette, the notebook cell tools inspector, 
and the tabs list. Finally, the menu bar (3) exposes actions available in Jupyter Lab including actions related to saving, 
editing, viewing and running notebooks.

Opening a Jupyter Notebook
--------------------------

To open an existing Jupyter notebook, double-click through the folders to find a notebook you're interested in, then double-click 
the notebook to open it in the main work area. Notebooks are indicated by the ``.ipynb`` file
extension. The JupyterLab interface also supports plain text and Markdown files.
